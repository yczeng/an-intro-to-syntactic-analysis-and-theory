# 1. Morphology: Starting with words

Morphology is the subdomain of linguistics dealing with word properties, particularly word structure.

Basic ideas:
1. Words come in categories
2. Words can be made of smaller units (morphemes)
3. Morphemes combine in a regular, rule-governed fashion
4. Morphemes can be silent

### 1.1 Words come in categories
* **Open class categories (new words can be freenly created in these categories):** Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb
* **Closed categories:** Preposition, Determiner, Numerals, Complementizers, Auziliaries, Modals, Coordinators, Negation/ Affirmation

#### 1.1.1 Word affixes are often category and sub-category specific
* If a word can be pluralized, it is a noun.
* Only verbs can have the past tense or progressive affixes (i.e. I dance, I danc-ed, I am danc-ing)
* Remember that negative results are usually uninformative.

#### 1.1.2. Synatactic contexts are sensitive to the same categories
Content is as title suggests

#### 1.1.3 Modifiers
category, modifier
* V, Adv
* N, A(djective)
* P, Intensifier
* A, Degree
* Adv, Degree

#### 1.1.4 Complementary distribution
* if two words have complementary distribution, then in a given context, either one of two elements may occur but not both
     * i.e. "the" and "these" are in complementary distribution
* Question: do categories really exist?

### 1.2 Word are made of smaller units: morphemes
* prefixes, suffixes, infixes (i.e. fan-fucking-tastic)

### 1.3 Morphemes combine in regular ways
i.e. national, nationalize, denationalize, nationalizing, denationalization, denationalizing

#### 1.3.2. Affixation
* There are 5!=120 orderings of these 4 morphemes but only this one forms a word. Theory: english speakers know some regularities about word formation.
* How to accept denationalization and reject other 119 forms?
     * speaker knows de, nation, al, ize, ation
     * is each morpheme free? prefix? suffix
     * what does the affix attach to
     * affixes must combine with something next to it. ok: nation nationiz national nationalize. not ok: nationizal
     * what results from combining an affix with a complement. i.e. national is an adjective. -al turns a N into an A.
* We call these specifications lexical entries.
* the collection of lexical entries is called a lexicon
* The mental representation of the lexicon. There is some evidence that frequently used words are represented in their complete forms.

#### 1.3.3 
```
── N
   ├── -ation
   └── V
       ├── -ize
       └── A
           ├── -al
           └── N
               └── nation
```

[N [V [A [N nation] -al] -ize] -ation]

#### 1.3.4 Selection and locality
* Branches cannot cross - morphological structures are respected by the temporal ordering
* We never find morphological trees where a node has more than one mother, more than one node lacks a mother, or a mother has more than two daughters.

#### 1.3.6 Compounds
* Obtain words by combining them.
* The English right hand head rule (RHHR): the rightmost element of a compound is the head of the compound. i.e. blackbird, jetblack, babysit.

#### 1.3.7 The categorial status of affixes
* Pre-fixes do not change category of word.
* Suffixes are able to change the category, obeys the right hand head rule. i.e. kill-er, manage-able, happi-ness
* Suffixes are like words
* Perspective on affixes extends to inflectional affixes (making singular/ plural and tense)

### 1.4 Apparent exceptions to the RHHR
* Conversion create a new word without the usage of a visible affix.
* i.e. father, butter, ship, nail are both nouns and verbs
* Postulating a silent present tense morpheme:
```
── T
   ├── V laugh
   └── T -ed

── T
   ├── V laugh
   └── T -s

── T
   ├── V laugh
   └── T e

── T
   ├── T
   └── V
       ├── V e
       └── N father
```
* If verbs such as father, wet, dry are related to the noun father, or the adjectives wet and dry are derived by affixation of a silent morpheme, then they are not roots: they are complex.
* No affixes that attach only to verb roots should be able to attach to these elements.
     * i.e. streer-age, wet-age, dry-age; betray-al, wet-al, dry-al
* failure is predicted by the silent affix proposal
* *The idea is that some parts of language structure may be unpronounced is a theoretically important one.*

### 1.5 Morphological Atoms
morphemes are minimal units of meaning and they can sometimes be silent

### 1.6 Conclusion
* Compositionality in morphology: the properties of complex words are determined by their parts and how those parts are assembled.
* A morpheme that can combine with a wide range of things is said to be productive. The English affix -al is not very productive while English noun compounding is very productive.
* The existence of productive affixes in a language opens the possibility for recursion in the morphology of language.
     * i.e. re-do, re-re-do, re-re-re-do; denationalization, denationalizational, denationalizationalize.
* *Recursion in morphology:* Morphology can have recursive affization and recursive compounding. When this happens, the language has infinitely many words.

### 1.7 Summary
1. The linguistic signal is discrete at levels phonology, morphology, suntaz. At each level, we have have atoms and rules combining these atoms.
The rules of morphological combination have the properties:
2. they are recursive
3. they are compositional
4. they produce tree liek structures
5. they use notions suhc as head and selection
6. the notion of selection used is local: it is sisterhood in a tree
