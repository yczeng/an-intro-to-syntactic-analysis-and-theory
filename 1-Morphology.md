# Morphology: Starting with words

morphology is the subdomain of linguistics dealing with word properties, particularly word structure.

basic ideas: 1) words come in categories, 2) words can be made of smaller units (morphemes), 3) morphemes combine in a regular, rule-governed fashion, 4) morphemes can be silent

## 1.1 Words come in categories

Open class categories (new words can be freenly created in these categories)
Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb

Closed categories: Preposition, Determiner, Numerals, Complementizers, Auziliaries, Modals, Coordinators, Negation/ Affirmation

## 1.1.1 Word affixes are often category and sub-category specific
If a word can be pluralized, it is a noun.

only verbs can have the past tense or progressive affixes (i.e. I dance, I danc-ed, I am danc-ing)

Remember that negative results are usually uninformative.


## 1.1.2. Synatactic contexts are sensitive to the same categories

Content is as title suggests

## 1.1.3 Modifiers

category, modifier
V, Adv
N, A(djective)
P, Intensifier
A, Degree
Adv, Degree

## 1.1.4 Complementary distribution
if two words have complementary distribution, then in a given context, either one of two eelements may occur but not both
i.e. the and these are in complementary distribution

Question: do categories really exist?

# 1.2 Word are made of smaller units: morphemes

prefixes, suffixes, infixes (i.e. fan-fucking-tastic)

# 1.3 Morphemes combin in regular ways
i.e. national, nationalize, denationalize, nationalizing, denationalization, denationalizing

## 1.3.2. Affixation
There are 5!=120 orderings of these 4 morphemes but only this one forms a word. Theory: english speakers know some regularities about word formation.
How to accept denationalization and rejecct other 119 forms?
1) speaker knows de, nation, al, ize, ation
2) is each morpheme free? prefix? suffix
3) what does the affix attach to
4) affixes must combine with something next to it. ok: nation nationiz national nationalize. not ok: nationizal
5. what results from combining an affix with a complement. i.e. national is an adjective. al turns a N into an A.
We call these specifications lexical entries.

-a: c-selects N to form A: natur-al
-ion: c-selects V to form N: realizat-ion, relat0ion
-ity: c-selects A to form N: profan-ity
-ism: c-selects A to form N: momdern-ism
-ist: c-selects A to form N: formal-ist
-ize: c-selects A to form V: special-ize

other suffixes select only select roots (too much to copy, see text)

the collection of lexical entries is called a lexicon

The mental representation of the lexicon. There is some evidence that frequently used words are represented in their complete forms.

## 1.3.3 

── N
   ├── -ation
   └── V
       ├── -ize
       └── A
           ├── -al
           └── N
               └── nation

[N[V[A[N nation]-al]-ize[-ation]]

##1.3.4 Selection and locality

Brahcnes cannot cross - morphological structures are respected by the temporal ordering

We never find morphological trees where a node has more than one mother, more than one node lacks a mother, or a mother has more than two daughters.
